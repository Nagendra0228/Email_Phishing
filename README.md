# üõ°Ô∏è Email Phishing Detection System

## üìã Description

A machine learning-powered web application that analyzes email content to detect potential phishing attempts. This system uses natural language processing and classification algorithms to help users identify suspicious emails and protect themselves from phishing attacks.

The application provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can paste email content and receive instant feedback on whether the email is likely to be a phishing attempt or legitimate communication.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Email Analysis**: Instant classification of email content as phishing or safe
- **Machine Learning Backend**: Uses trained ML models for accurate detection
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive web interface for easy interaction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Advanced text processing for feature extraction
- **Pre-trained Models**: Comes with pre-trained phishing detection model
- **Flask Web Framework**: Lightweight and fast web application
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Text Processing**: TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Model Persistence**: joblib
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Email_Phishing.git
   cd Email_Phishing
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask joblib scikit-learn numpy pandas
   ```

4. **Verify model files exist**
   Ensure the following files are present in the project directory:
   - `phishing_email_model.pkl`
   - `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the application** by running `python app.py`
2. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Paste email content** into the text area
4. **Click "Check Email"** to analyze the content
5. **View the result** - the system will display whether the email is "Phishing Email" or "Safe Email"

### Example Email Texts to Test

**Suspicious/Phishing Email Example:**
```
Urgent! Your account will be suspended immediately. Click here to verify your credentials: http://suspicious-link.com/verify
Send your password to confirm your identity.
```

**Legitimate Email Example:**
```
Hello,
Thank you for your recent purchase. Your order #12345 has been shipped and will arrive within 3-5 business days.
Best regards,
Customer Service Team
```

### API Usage

The application also accepts POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint:

```python
import requests

data = {'email_text': 'Your email content here'}
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/predict', data=data)
```
